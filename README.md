# ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory

## 📜 Overview

</p>

We introduce ReasoningBank, a memory mechanism for agents that learns from both 
successful and failed trajectories, with reasoning stored as memory content.

</p>

Building upon this memory formulation, we propose memory-aware test-time scaling,
which leverages the bidirectional synergy between memory and test-time scaling,
establishing experience-driven memory as another scaling dimension for agent
systems.


## 📂 Code Setup
We release code for `SWE-Bench` (software engineering) and `WebArena` (web-browsing),
as in corresponding directories.

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then run
these commands from the repository root:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv sync --locked
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This installs the runtime dependencies, the vendored `mini-swe-agent` in editable
mode, and the development tools (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `ruff`).
Python 3.12 is required: BrowserGym 0.14.1 pins Playwright 1.44 and greenlet 3.0.3,
which do not support Python 3.13. Keep the BrowserGym pins to preserve benchmark
evaluation behavior.

You can also run commands without activating the environment, for example
`uv run python main.py`, `uv run pytest`, or `uv run ruff check .`.

For WebArena, install Chromium once:

```bash
uv run playwright install chromium
```

On Linux, if Playwright reports missing system libraries, install them with
`uv run playwright install-deps chromium` (requires administrator privileges).

### 0. LLM Configuration
Currently we support three model families: 
- **GPT**: To use GPT models (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`), you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
  ```

- **Gemini & Claude**: To use Gemini models (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`) or Claude (`claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219`) on Vertex AI, you need to configure Google Cloud authentication.
  1.  Install the Google Cloud CLI and log in to set up Application Default Credentials (ADC):
      ```bash
      gcloud auth application-default login
      ```
  2.  Set your project and location as environment variables, as they are required by clients like the one for Claude on Vertex AI:
      ```bash
      export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
      export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="your-region"
      export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="True"
      ```


### 1. WebArena
#### Docker Configuration
Make sure to correctly install `browsergym` following the [official documentation](https://github.com/ServiceNow/BrowserGym).

The next step is to download and config docker environment for WebArena. Please refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/gasse/webarena-setup/tree/main/webarena),
executing the scripts follow the numerical order of file names. Before executing,
make sure to config the address of each website in corresponding scripts as
instructed correspondingly.

#### Directory Structure

* `WebArena/agents/`: implementation for web agents integrating with browsergym
* `WebArena/autoeval/`: llm-as-a-judge for obtaining correctness signal for trajectories
* `WebArena/config_files/`: data processing for webarena tasks
* `WebArena/prompt/`: instructions used across the implementation

#### Data preprocessing

Download raw test files from [here](https://github.com/web-arena-x/webarena/blob/main/config_files/test.raw.json) and put it to `config_files`. The repo also vendors a patched copy at `third_party/webarena/test.raw.json` with shopping-split annotation corrections; use either one.

Run `generate_config_files.py` to process raw test data to config files as input.

#### Use the vendored `webarena` tree

The repo ships a patched `webarena/` harness at `third_party/webarena/` (corrected shopping annotations, wishlist eval fix, `fill('','')` guard, `retry_with_force=True` clicks) to make environment and corresponding evaluation more robust and stable. Prepend it to `PYTHONPATH` so it shadows the pip-installed `browsergym.webarena`:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/third_party:$PYTHONPATH"
```

`webarena` is a namespace package, so no code edits are required — every `webarena.*` submodule resolves to the vendored copy.


#### Run the code

Run directly with ReasoningBank: `bash run.sh`, config `model`, `output_dir`, and
`website`, and `memory_mode` accordingly.

To run with scaling setting, please refer to
`pipeline_scaling.py` and `induce_scaling.py`.

### 2. SWE-Bench
We built upon [mini-swe-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/mini-swe-agent).
The root `uv sync --locked` command installs `./third_party` in editable mode,
so changes to the vendored agent are picked up immediately. Verify the CLI with
`uv run mini-extra --help` from the repository root. The `swebench` subcommand
initializes its Google GenAI client on import, so it requires the LLM
configuration above even when invoked with `--help`.

The script `SWE-Bench/run.sh` provides direct running command, which will generate
result files in the output directory. Before running, make sure the
configuration for VertexAI is properly configured as instructed in `run.sh`.

For evaluation, please refer to `sb-cli` command in the [official documentation](https://mini-swe-agent.com/latest/usage/swebench/).
